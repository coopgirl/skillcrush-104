			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>That's what I keep hearing but I feel so freaking stupid at this point. I know what I'm doing but I don't know what I'm doing and I'm having a hard time figuring out how to figure out what comes next. Where oh where do the HTML files "live" in WordPress? How do I change the structure? I can see it but I can't see the map of it all. Arrggh!</p>

			<p>But in the lingo of the yogis, all is coming at some point. Right? </p>
